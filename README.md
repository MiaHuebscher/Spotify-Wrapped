# Spotify-Wrapped
A program that utilizes the Spotify API to analyze my listening behavior on Spotify. 

Specifically, it identifies the following:
1) top n artists I've been listening to (short, medium, or long-term period)
2) top n tracks I've been listening to (short, medium, or long-term period)
3) the number of songs I have saved
4) the total duration of my saved songs
5) the n most artists I have in my saved songs
6) the longest song I have saved
7) the shortest song I have saved

Eventually, I'll want to add more analyses and perhaps create a website/app that enables me to look at my Spotify data at any time (not just during wrapped season!)
