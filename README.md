# Spotify-Wrapped
An API that interacts with Spotify to retreive data on recent listening behavior and playlists.

My driver program demonstrates the following functionalities of the API
1) top n artists I've been listening to (short, medium, or long-term period)
2) top n tracks I've been listening to (short, medium, or long-term period)
3) Any niche songs in my most recent listening
4) the number of songs I have saved

Eventually, I'll want to add more analyses and create a website that enables me to look at my Spotify data at any time (not just during wrapped season!)
